Database lifecycle MCP tools.

Provides three tools for managing the active Gramps database connection:

- ``open_database``   — open (or switch to) a database file
- ``close_database``  — release the connection so Gramps Desktop can use it
- ``reload_database`` — re-read the database after Gramps Desktop made changes
